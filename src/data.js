      First worked as asst. SA for Hillsborough County, eventually resigned to run for FL AG (2011-2019). 
      Became FL's 1st female AG, most likely due to various guest appearances (MSNBC, FOX News and

    professional: `
      During tenure as FL AG, led or joined unsuccessful attempts to overturn Obama's ACA

      for pre-existing conditions). Gave speech at the 2016 RNC (led the "Lock her up!" chant).

      with Trump) and became a lobbyist for Qatar. Later, she played a key role in Trump's first
